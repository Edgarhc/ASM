# Contributing Guideline
### 1. You should work hard to improve our code.
You should improve our works to support more devices, work faster, look good, and satisfy many users as much as possible.

### 2. You should append our license at the first of code.
You should append [this](LICENSE_HEADER) at the header of the every code.
> Note: currently license is not developed yet, and also there is no header yet.

### 3. Try to use annotations.
You can use `@NonNull` or `@Nullable` at the every code.<br>

### 4. Try to make javadocs in all files.
Other contributors and people can understand code easily, if javadoc exists.<br>
**Making javadoc might be annoying, but it will help your code to improve.

### 5. Thanks to all pull requests.
There are many developers, and they can help us to improve our code.

> **We :heart: our all contributors.**
